## ☝️ Important info. Please read it to understand the whole concept.

⚖️ The game is well balanced by design, which means focusing on just one area while ignoring others won’t get you far. Progress comes from developing **all** aspects of your city and gameplay - economy, tech, troops, heroes, gear, buildings, etc. Don’t underestimate any part of the system - everything works together to make you stronger.

For example, rushing your `Town Center` while ignoring your `Command Center` or troop trainings is a **bad strategy**. You might unlock new buildings faster, but without strong troops or rally capacity, your city will be weak and vulnerable - and you’ll struggle to keep up in events or battles.

🏆 Participating in alliance events is **crucial** if you want to grow fast. Events like Swordland Showdown, Eternity's Reach,  Alliance Championship, Cesares, Viking's Vengeance and etc. offer **valuable rewards** including resources and tokens that are impossible to get elsewhere without spending real money. Skipping these events means missing out on some of the best free-to-play progression tools in the game.

🤝 Remember, this is a **team game** - your personal growth matters, but so does the strength of the alliance. Helping each other, joining events, and contributing to shared goals is what pushes everyone forward. When the alliance grows, you grow with it.

## 🔄 Daily routine tips. A bit boring, but necessary

Progress comes from small, consistent steps. Even simple daily actions add up over time - don’t underestimate them. Here’s a quick list of tasks to keep you moving forward every day:

  - Complete **daily missions**
  - **Donate resources** daily to the `Alliance > Tech` tab. You earn alliance tokens and can spend them on useful items in the shop
  - Check `Shop` and `Alliance Shop` daily and **buy necessary items** there
  - Make sure you always have at least a couple of `Advanced Teleporters` in you backpack. You may need them during Sanctuary events and etc.
  - Start **terror rallies** daily. Depending on your rally capacity and troops power, create at least lvl 4 or lvl 5 rallies
  - Don't forget to complete **Intel missions**. Golden and Purple ones are the most valuable and worth prioritizing.
  - Since **stamina** is limited, it’s best to use it wisely. I recommend splitting it between `Intel missions` and `Terror rallies`. Both give valuable rewards and help with steady progress without burning through your stamina on just one activity.
  - Log in at least **twice a day**. You get 120 free stamina in the first half of the day and another 120 in the second. Don’t miss it and try to use it all.
  - Never let your construction queues, academy and trainings stale! Log in often to start construction and training right away — keeping things moving nonstop speeds up your progress!

## 🛒 Shopping tips

### What is worth buying in different shops:

#### Alliance Shop
- All available `speedups` - always useful. Buy them on sale if possible, but full price is fine if you have enough tokens.
- `Advanced Teleporters` - expensive, so best to grab during sales. Skip if you already have a good stash.
- `Expedition` items - used to recall troops. Keep a few in your backpack - they come in handy more often than you'd think.
  
#### Nomadic Merchant

I don’t recommend spending diamonds here. I only trade resources for resources (like bread, wood, stone, iron) and never buy speedups. Use the **refresh** button - it’s free and helps find better deals.

#### Mystery

You get one free refresh per day in the Mystery Shop. Sometimes it offers free items, so don’t miss your chance to grab them!  
`Mystery Shop tokens` are rare - avoid spending them on speedups or common items. Save them for special, valuable purchases like `Forgehammers`.

#### Arena

I personally only buy the `Custom Mythic Hero Gear Chest` here. Top-level hero gear is super rare, so it’s definitely worth saving up for. Be patient and collect those 12,000 tokens to get it!

#### VIP

Available items vary by your VIP level. In my opinion, the only worthwhile purchases here are `Stamina` and `Advanced Teleporters` they are always on sale.

#### Alliance Championship Shop

I only buy `Gilded Threads` and `Satin` here. Avoid spending tokens on shards and speedups - they’re too expensive and not worth it.

#### Swordland

- `Charm Designs` and `Charm guides` are worth buying. 
- Small amount of `Gilded Threads` and `Satin` if you don't have enough or can't buy them in the `Alliance Championship Shop`.
- I might buy `Artisan’s Vision` later, but since I can’t use it now, I don’t spend tokens on it yet.

#### Gem

- `Server Megaphone` - the only thing I allow you to buy here :D


### Avoid Impulsive Purchases

Think twice before spending your tokens or diamonds. Impulsive buys can drain your resources quickly and slow down your progress. Prioritize valuable items that truly help your growth and save for big rewards.

Please, **never** buy shards (rare or epic), XP, conquest skill books and manuals - otherwise, you’re not my friend! 😡

## ⚒️ How to reduce construction time

- Try to get the **Saul** hero and boost him to at least 2 or 3 stars. Upgrade his `Resourceful` skill to increase construction speed. I have a 3-star Saul with `Resourceful` at level 4, which gives me an extra 12% construction speed bonus. Further upgrades cost a lot of shards, and I’m not sure I’ll get them, so 3 stars is quite enough for now.
**Saul's skill is passive, no need to activate it**
- **Use the `Double Time` decree** in the `Court of Justice`. But first make sure you have enough resources for starting the upgrade!
- Upgrade your **Wolf** pet as much as possible. His unique skill can boost your construction speed by up to **+15%**. I have mine at level 4, so I’m okay with getting a 12% boost. The next level needs `Medallions`, which are quite costly - in my opinion, they’re not worth spending Event tokens on.
**Activate the Wolf's skill before starting construction.**
- Think and plan your building upgrades in advance. If you’re about to start upgrading your `Town Center` or `Embassy`, **apply for the `Chef Minister` role in the King’s Castle** to get an extra 10% speed boost. But don’t apply if you don’t really need it — others might want that perk too!


❗️ If you accidentally start a building upgrade without activating your pet’s skills or the Double Time decree, **don’t worry**! You can cancel the upgrade and get your resources back. Then activate your boosts and restart the upgrade to enjoy the speed bonus.

I recommend keeping one construction queue busy with `Town Center` and `Embassy` upgrades. The second queue is working on upgrading other buildings. Once my Embassy is done, I prioritize using the second queue to start upgrading the Command Center as soon as possible.
I haven’t purchased a second queue with real money - instead, I buy it every 2 days for 1,000 diamonds when needed.

**If you're short on time or resources**, it's okay to skip upgrading buildings like `Storehouse`, `Infirmary`, `Mill`, `Sawmill`, `Quarry`, and `Iron Mine`. Other buildings are much more important, and I personally prefer upgrading them to the max level available.

## 🔫 Troops are important

A strong city depends on having plenty of **high-level troops**. Don’t waste them attacking other players — training new ones takes time. Save your army for events and defense where it really matters.

**Training tip:** If you're going to use your `training speedups`, make sure you're doing it in the most efficient way.

Go to the `King’s Castle` (the center of the map) and apply for the `Noble Advisor` role in the `Appointment` tab. You’ll be assigned a time slot, and when it’s your turn, you’ll get **+50% training speed** and increased **training capacity** for 30 minutes. Use this boost wisely with your training speedups to quickly train and promote troops.

Also, I recommend upgrading the `Battle` tab in the `Academy` — it directly boosts your troops power and makes your attacks much more effective.

---

## 💊 Healing

I **never use healing speedups** except during the `Swordland` event. Normally, you can heal in batches with alliance help, so there’s no need to spend your speedups on healing outside of event.

Healing faster during the `Swordland` event lets you get back to attacking sooner, and more attacks mean more points and better rewards. So collecting healing speedups for the event is a smart move!


---

## 🎯 Events are the key to fast growth

Try to participate in team events whenever you can. We have plenty of players online during Bear Hunt, but don’t miss out on the other events either — every event helps you grow stronger!

You can’t grow fast without participating in events. `Governor Gear` and `Charm upgrades` give a huge boost to your **troops power**, and the only real way to get the needed resources for them without spending money is by earning them through **events**.


---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Skipping events and thinking your participation doesn’t matter. Every player counts and can change the outcome - **don’t underestimate your power**!
- Attacking other players’ cities just for kill points is a mistake. Kill points don’t increase your power - a strong army does. **Don’t waste your troops** on inactive players if you want to grow faster.
- Using construction speedups when you don't have enough resources to start a new building upgrade. Remember, your construction queues **should never stale**.
- Using your construction speedups on secondary buildings isn’t the best move. I recommend saving them for `Embassy` or `Town Center` upgrades — or `Trainings`, if they unlock new troops of a higher level.
